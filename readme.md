# Daleskii's Joke Project

Hello folks, welcome to my **Joke Project**. This project main objective is to display a questioin if the user decides to do so, also allows the user to answer the question in input. The app is suppose to allow the reader to click through questions. If the user at any point doesnt decides to do any, they can always click to go back to the home page.

## Instructions

1.  To set up the this project, I first retrieved a joke the a API from [Rapid Api](https://rapidapi.com/moussasaidi01/api/jokes34)

2.  After I retrieved the API, I layed out my HTML and CSS and pages.

3.  I then started creating dynamic behavior for user interaction through javascript.

**Hope you Enjoy my first-solo project, despite the API issues**
